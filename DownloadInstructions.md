Once installed, make sure Microsoft's Python extension is installed. Click View -> Extensions and search for Python. 

### Install GitHub

### Clone your GitHub repository
Open a command prompt. Press the Windows key and search for "cmd". Press enter to open the command prompt. From here we'll enter command prompt calls to clone your repository.

First copy your repository URL. For example, our class repository has the URL: https://github.com/jamesleasure/2019SpringIT2750. I'll use this in place of your repository link for the following examples.

```
git clone https://github.com/jamesleasure/2019SpringIT2750
