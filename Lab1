#IT 2750 - Scripting for Cybersecurity
#Lab 1

Use Chapter 1 to complete this lab. 

1. Create a folder in your repository called Lab1.
2. In the Lab 1 folder add a file called README.md.
3. In your README.md file, describe - in a few sentences - what we've covered in chapter 1. 
4. Again, in README.md, answer the following questions:
  a. What are primitive elements?
  b. How can we combine primitive elements?
  c. What number is represented by 319e5?
5. Create a new file called sequence1.py. In sequence1.py, answer problem 1.30: Use the range function to create a sequence of the multiples of 5 up to 50.
6. Create a file called sequence2.py. In sequence2.py, answer problem 1.31: Use the range function to create a sequence of numbers from −10 to 10.
7. Create a file called drawCircle.py. In drawCircle, use Listing 1.7 to draw three circles.
8. Create a file called loops.py. In loops.py, output the following sequences: 1) 1-10 increment by 2) 20-15 decrement by 1, and 3) 0-100 increment by 2.
