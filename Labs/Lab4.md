## IT 2750 - Lab 4

*Use Chapter 4 to complete this lab.*

1. Create a folder in your repository called Lab4.
2. In the Lab 4 folder add a file called README.md. Note: create all of the following files in the lab 4 folder.
3. In your README.md file, describe - in a few sentences - what we've covered in lesson 4. 
4. Create a file called stats.py. In code, create functions that compute the mean, median, and mode for a list of integers. Use the following list as a test case: [34, 23, 54, 43, 53, 43, 99, 43, 74, 57, 82, 80, 17]. Include the values of mean, median, and mode in README.md.
5. Create a file called lists.py. Complete the following in lists.py:
     1. Create a list by calling the list() function with the following string "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." Convert all letters to lowercase before calling the list() function. 
     2. Sort the list.
     3. Create a function called getMostFrequent() that outputs which letter(s) (excluding spaces) occurs the most often in the sentence. Indicate which letter and the in README.md.
     4. Create another function called uniqueLetters() that creates a list of all unique characters in the string/list. Then it should ouput each unique character in order.
6. When complete, push your Lab4 folder to GitHub. Make sure it pushed successfully and then post the URL to your folder in comments sections of the Lab 4 Blackboard assignment.
